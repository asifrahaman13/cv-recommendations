# CV Recommendation üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

The goal of this project is to recommend top 5 CVs based on the job descriptions of the companies. 

The archieve folder contains all the pdfs of the candidates. The folder itself contins a folder named data which again contains another folder called data. The child folder contains different other folders each named according to certain domains e.g ENGINEERING, BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT etc. They contains the pdfs of the respective candidates. 

How to run the application:

Fork the repository:

```
https://github.com/asifrahaman13/cv-recommendations.git
```


<br/>
<br/>

## Run The Scripts

Create a virtual environment. It is not madnatory but highly recommended.‚úÖ

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install necessary packages in you environment.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use this activated kernel to run the index.ipynb file. You can run the index.py file alternatively.

There are two executable python scripts namely index.ipynb, and index.py files. The index.ipynb file was used for building the primary code structure while the index.py file consists of class based components. The codes and architecture of both are similar. The index.py file is more structural and consists of more reusable components. 

To run the index.ipynb file just click on the run all button on the top of VS code or Jupyter Notebook.

You can also do it through command line.

```
cd codes/
jupyter nbconvert --to html index.ipynb
```

To run the index.py file for the unix based system:

```
cd codes/
python3 index.py
```

Or 

For others:
```
cd codes/
python index.py
```

## Run Docker Container

If you want to run the docker image then use the following steps:

```
docker pull asifrdocker/cvrecommendation:tag
```

Next run the docker container.

```
docker run asifrdocker/cvrecommendation:tag
```

Additionally to find whether the container is running you can run the following commands to check the logs:

```
docker ps
```

Copy the container id

```
docker logs -f <container id>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Note:**: The code is written utilizing tensors. If your system has GPU Support (at least 4 GB of GPU Memory) then you will get good acceraleration in your computations. However if your device do not have GPU access the program will still run but at much slower rate. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of data and Python will reqauire some time for computations. üêç However still it may run out of the GPU memory. In that case please run the code in google colab or comment out the following line:

```
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```
Next use the following instead:

```
device = torch.device("cpu")
```

‚úÖ**For reference**: In my Hexacore Rynzen 5 5600H processor with 4GB RTX 3050 Graphics card and 16 GB RAM, it took approx ~25 min to execute the entire code. It took ~20 min to extract all pdf data. ~2 min to perform the similarity and other preprocessing operations.
