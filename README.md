# CV Recommendation üë®üèº‚Äçüíª

The goal of this project is to recommend top 5 CVs based on the job descriptions of the companies. 

The archieve folder contains 

How to run the application:

Fork the repository:

```
https://github.com/asifrahaman13/cv-recommendations.git
```

Create a virtual environment. It is not madnatory but highly recommended.‚úÖ

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install necessary packages in you environment.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use this activated kernel to run the index.ipynb file. You can run the index.py file alternatively.

To run the index.ipynb file just click on the run all button on the top.

You can also do it through command line.

```
cd codes/
jupyter nbconvert --to html index.ipynb
```

To run the index.py file for the unix based system:

```
cd codes/
python3 index.py
```

Or 

For others:
```
cd codes/
python index.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Note:**: The code is written utilizing tensors. If your system has GPU Support (at least 4 GB of GPU Memory) then you will get good acceraleration in your computations. However if your device do not have GPU access the program will still run but at much slower rate. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of data and Python will reqauire some time for computations. üêç However still it may run out of the GPU memory. In that case please run the code in google colab or comment out the following line:

```
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```
Next use the following instead:

```
device = torch.device("cpu")
```

‚úÖ**For reference**: In my Hexacore Rynzen 5 5600H processor with 4GB RTX 3050 Graphics card and 16 GB RAM, it took approx ~25 min to execute the entire code. It took ~20 min to extract all pdf data. ~2 min to perform the similarity and other preprocessing operations.
